The name of the program is Motor model in FEMM.

Autor: Moskalev Yuriy.
This program was written using Python.

It allows to create motor models using FEMM programm (by David Meeker).
In order to control FEMM is used a Python package (pyFEMM)
witch allows for the operation of Finite Element Method Magnetics (FEMM)
via a library of Python functions.

Motor model in FEMM could be used for optimization motor magnetic system.
